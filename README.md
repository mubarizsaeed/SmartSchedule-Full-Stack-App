Welcome to the SmartSchedule GitHub! SmartSchedule is a comprehensive all in one schedule application designed to streamline your scheduling needs. A key feature I implemented is a web scraper using Playwright to automatically pull in event data from brighspace calender.  You'll find more information on this web scraper feature along with details on installation, other app features, usage instructions, and how to contribute to the project withing the Wiki.
